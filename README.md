# tow-lots

This project that is up for adoption.

## Problem Statement

KCMO runs monthly auctions of cars and other items (boats,
scooters, etc) that are unclaimed from city tow lots, but
information about the items up for auction isnâ€™t easily accessible
by the salvage dealers.

Auction data is avaliable on [data.kcmo.org Kansas City Monthly Car Auction](https://data.kcmo.org/Traffic/Kansas-City-Monthly-Car-Auction/2uje-k9n5). Presumably, there
are current auction attendees who know how to work the system,
and most of the items for auction are purchase, but we believe there
may be an opportunity to increase revenue, reduce waste (into the
landfill), or even connect more people to low cost vehicles with
greater accessibility and transparency to the data.

MVP: 

## The workflow

Auctioneer lists items by:

* Lot #
* make
* model
* year
* VIN
* mileage
* keys (if the vehicle comes with keys)
* reason vehicle is for sale
* vehicle number (to identify during auction)

 Buyer is able to see all items, narrow items by search & filter, and see the time and date of the upcoming auction.
(These functions are performed well by sites like 

## Future Opportunities

* Addition of photos to vehicle listings (may be available in second version after demo to Nate, will not be included in first)
* Wishlist - ability to select desired items from a "frequently sold" list, where the site will send the buyer a notification when one of these items is listed for sale (via email or tweet?)

Online auctions? How to measure the impact or change on auction
results based on opening the data/making it more accessible? (For
the Brigade/developers) low risk way to test skills development

## Resources
Access to Open Data KC's API and raw data set.  [https://data.kcmo.org/Traffic/Kansas-City-Monthly-Car-Auction/2uje-k9n5](https://data.kcmo.org/Traffic/Kansas-City-Monthly-Car-Auction/2uje-k9n5)


## What we need

Is a person or team to take ownership of this project and create a KC Auto Auction site with timely, searchable info about items
available at auction.

Possible steps:

* Review the existing data source
* Design a system
* Create a road map and issues that can be followed to implement
* Implement


* See [Issues](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/tow-lots/issues)
